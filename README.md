# About Connect Four
Connect Four is a game in which two players take turns dropping red or yellow coloured discs into a vertically suspended 7 x 6 grid. Discs fall to the bottom of the grid, occupying the next available space.

A player wins by connecting four of their discs horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
